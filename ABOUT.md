# I used java because :
##### Java is a platform independent language, and it's my favorite language.

# Development Cycle : 

### I've created a bean class to represent the offer info and then create the service calss to send the request and fill the bean with the offer information and then create the controller class to get the input from user and call the service class to get the results filtered depend on user input and then create the jsp page to handle how the data will be viewed to the client.

## I've learned a lot from this task since I've never used Travise and Heroku before.
